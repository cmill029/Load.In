This repository contains an Android application while I was getting my undergraduate degree in computer science.
It was created in three months with a team of five other developers.
The app itself is intended to help do it yourself movers plan for a move by taking dimensions of boxes and creating an efficient and safe plan
to load a rental truck. There are a few features that the app would have given more time, including photogrammetry in order to generate 3D models
from images rather than directly input dimenions.

The Android app files are contained within the "app" directory, the "database" directory contains the files for our SQL database that the app uses for data
management, and the "webapi" directory is exactly that, a webapi that works as an inbetween for our application and our database. The "common" directory is
a location that contains the majority of the classes used throughout the application and webapi, for example the class for our inventory system is located
there.
